# IT326Project | German Credit Risk


## Project Description:
Credit risk refers to the possibility that a borrower will fail to pay their financial obligations, resulting in losses for the lender. The German Credit Risk dataset contains records of individuals from Germany seeking credit, reflecting the types of decisions lenders regularly face. The issue this project seeks to solve is the challenge of accurately distinguishing trustworthy borrowers from high-risk applicants, so that lending decisions are both financially fair to individuals. By analyzing this dataset, we aim to identify patterns that classify applicants as ‘good’ or ‘bad’ credit risks, cluster them by similar characteristics, and ultimately support fairer and more accurate outcomes in lending.


## Project Motivation:

For banks and financial institutions, credit risk analysis is a critical challenge, as poor lending decisions can cause heavy losses and unfair outcomes on applicants. Beyond finance, loan decisions shake key opportunities like housing, education, and businesses, so mistakes can directly harm people’s lives. The motivation of this project is to minimize unfair risks and promote lending practices that are accurate and responsible.

# IT326Project | German Credit Risk


## Project Description:

The German Credit Risk dataset contains records of individuals from Germany seeking credit, representing the kinds of decisions lenders have to make. For banks and financial institutions, credit risk is a key factor, since poor lending decisions can cause major financial losses or unfair outcomes for applicants.

This issue is important because loan decisions and their results strongly affect peopleâ€™s lives, and mistakes can cause serious financial and personal consequences. By analyzing this dataset, through this project we aim to identify patterns that classify applicants as good or bad credit risk categories, cluster them by similar characteristics, and support fairer outcomes in lending.


## Project Motivation:

Credit risk analysis is one of the most impactful elements in the financial sector. For banks and lending institutions, deciding whether to approve a loan directly impacts both their stability and the lives of applicants. A wrong or ill-informed decision can lead to major financial losses for the lender or unfair denial of opportunities for borrowers.

The German Credit dataset is especially valuable because it captures real-world cases of individuals applying for credit in Germany, reflecting the complexities of financial decision-making. By analyzing this dataset, we can:
identify risk patterns, support fairness and transparency, and enhance decision-making.

# IT326Project | German Credit Risk

## Project Description:

The German Credit Risk dataset contains records of individuals from Germany seeking credit, representing the kinds of decisions lenders have to make. For banks and financial institutions, credit risk is a key factor, since poor lending decisions can cause major financial losses or unfair outcomes for applicants.

This issue is important because loan decisions and their results strongly affect peopleâ€™s lives, and mistakes can cause serious financial and personal consequences. By analyzing this dataset, through this project we aim to identify patterns that classify applicants as good or bad credit risk categories, cluster them by similar characteristics, and support fairer outcomes in lending.
